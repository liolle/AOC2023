## Gear Ratios

[Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

## Solution

Up to this point, we have been able to generate a list of numbers around a symbol (as described in [see](../part1/README.md)).

Our next objective is to refine this list by filtering out symbols that do not have exactly two numbers around them.

## Demo

```bash
node two.js
```
