[Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13)

### Problem Overview

In each pattern, you'll need to locate and fix the smudge that causes a different reflection line to be valid .

`smudge`: exactly one . or # should be the opposite type.

### Approach

We can solve the problem through brute force by calculating reflection lines for each smudge position and maintaining a record of the various lines of reflection.

### Algorithm

## Demo

```bash
node solution.mjs <path-to-input>
```
